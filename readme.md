### Level 1

The user spawns into the game world along with a set of 5 enemies. The player has to fend of the enemies using the sword attack they are granted by default at the start of the game. The user has 100 health and takes 1 damage everytime they touch/get attacked by an enemy. There are three waves to this level that the user has to get through to get past this level. A new wave starts when the user completes the previous one. There is also a stats panel on the bottom left of the screen that shows the users current level, current wave and health. At the bottom right of the screen, there is a pause button that the user can hit to pause the game. Once the user completes this level, the game transitions to the next level.

### Level 2

This level adds the ranged attack weapon by pressing 2 can swap to the ranged attack. Swapping back to the sword attack can be done by pressing 1. Ranged attack does less damage to enemies than a sword attack allowing to keep distance from oncoming enemies. Waves have 15 enemies and a larger open map to incentivize the use of the ranged attack. The ranged attack fires in the direction of the last direction the player was moving.

### Level 3

The level adds the weapon of a bomb by pressing 3, and you need it to face a boss that chases you down, heâ€™s big but gets random bursts of speed when his prey is near, he also shoots dangerous lightning bolts at you, while spawning his slime everywhere.
